<h1>ALEX RADDATZ</h1>
<h3>Freshman in Greenville, South Carolina</h3>

<p>I am currently a freshman at Bob Jones University studying computer science.I work in the summers refurbishing homes.</p>

<p> I enjoy participating in my church by helping it run various events in the summer such as soccer camps. 
I also enjoy playing soccer and video games, hiking with my friends in the woods while looking for a 
place to <a href="https://www.eaglesnestoutfittersinc.com">eno</a>, and reading.</p>

<p>I am interested in using my degree for software development, creating an in-home artificial intelligence such 
as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Echo-And-Alexa-Devices/b?ie=UTF8&node=9818047011"> Alexa</a>, or developing robotics.</p>
